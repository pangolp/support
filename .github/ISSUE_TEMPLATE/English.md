### Wow-CMS English support

Hello and welcome. Before we start we need to ask you a couple of questions. That will help us to have the necessary information, and then, try to give you the best possible support. **Why do we use this medium and not answer directly on discord?** *Simple, because through issue, first, the whole issue is enclosed in a single conversation and on the other hand, once the issue is solved, it can be useful for other people, because even though the issue is closed, it is still visible and we can provide the link to another person in the future who has the same problem.*
